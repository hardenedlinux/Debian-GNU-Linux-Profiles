## Powerful ssh(1) options you don't know.

##### Introduction.

Nearly everyone using *nices knows that `ssh(1)` is a tool able to log into remote computer running ssh server securely, and some of them knows files can be transmit from/to remote computer using `scp(1)`, `sftp(1)`, and [FISH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Files_transferred_over_shell_protocol)(mainly used by the proprietary SecureCRT, while most gui ssh clients support sftp), but fewer knows ssh is more powerful than they thought.

##### ssh_config(5) options and command line options.

Options provided by `ssh(1)` are usually abbreviated forms of option for ssh_config(5) shared between `ssh(1)`, `scp(1)` and `sftp(1)`, which can be presented on command line using `-oOPTION=PARAMETER` form. For example, `-oCompression=yes` has the same effect of shorter command line option `-C`, while `-oIdentityFile=$IDFILE` is identical to `-I $IDFILE`.

Because of that, we are going to a naming scheme in the form of `SshConfigOption(single-character-option-for-cli)[:]`. For example, option `-oIdentityFile=$IDFILE` will be expressed as `IdentityFile(I): identity_file`, which means there is an option in ssh_config(5) called `IdentityFile`, which can be abbreviated as `-I` in the command line, and this option has a parameter for `identity_file`. For boolean option which has parameter `yes` or `no` in ssh_config(5), and no parameter in command line, the colon is omitted, e.g. `Compression(C)`. 

Some options could be set to `no` in the command line even it is set to `yes` in the config file, e.g. `ForwardX11(X,~x)`, in which `-X` could enable this feature in the command line (`-oForwardX11=yes`), while `-x` is used to disable it (`-oForwardX11=no`).

We are going to introduce some powerful but useful options below.

###### LocalForward(L): [bindaddr:]port:host:hostport & RemoteForward(R): [bindaddr:]port:host:hostport & DynamicForward(D): [bindaddr:]port

SSH protocol has the ability to multiplex many bidirectional byte stream TCP-like connection inside one, which can be accessed via this two options.

When an SSH connection has finished creating, the `sshd` on the remote host will `fork(2)` itself twice to produce a process running under the user account to be logged in, from which the program to call or the shell is launched via `fork(2)` and `exec(2)` combination. This process and the client running on the localhost act as the two endpoints of the SSH connection.

If `LocalForward` is announced, the local endpoint (the client) will listen to `[bindaddr:]port` on local host (`bindaddr` is to assign the address for `port` to bind, if `bindaddr` is omitted, `port` will bind to `localhost`, unless `GatewayPorts(g)` is announced, in which situation `port` will bind to wildcard address.), once the ports get incoming connection, the remote endpoint will connect to `host:hostport` (in the sight of remote host), and then all data communication with `[bindaddr:]port` will be tunneled to the remote server listening to `host:hostport`, actually "PULL" the a server accessible for the remote host onto the local host in front of you.

![RemoteForward](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/SSH_Tunnel_%28remote%29.png)

`RemoteForward` works in the very same concept, except that it is the remote endpoint who listens to `[bindaddr:]port`, and it is the local endpoint who connects to `host:hostport` in the sight of local host when the port gets incoming connection. It is to "PUSH" a server accessible for the local host to the remote.

Unix domain sockets can be forwarded as well. In this case, either the listening part or the connecting part can be a path to the unix domain socket. ssh can forward a unix domain socket to a TCP socket, and vice versa: `[bindaddr:]port:PATH_ON_REMOTE_HOST` or `PATH_ON_LOCAL_HOST:host:hostport`.

Assuming you, with a laptop running *nix operating system, are going to manage a MariaDB running on server `db.xxx.com` which is accessible for you via SSH with username `dbadmin`, but the server process is listening to `localhost(127.0.0.1):3306` of THAT machine, so you cannnot directly access the database. With LocalForward(L), you can 'pull' the database ('s port) to the laptop just in front of you:

`$ ssh -L 13306:localhost:3306 dbadmin@db.xxx.com`

Now you can use local management tools to access the database by connecting to port 13306 on YOUR LAPTOP's localhost.

***

This time, you are going to login to a internal GNU/Linux server `server.i.xxx.com` via SSH for package upgrade (assuming you have the suitable permissions to invoke `sudo(8)` for package management) , you are feasible to access Internet via an HTTP proxy `proxy.i.xxx.com:8080`, but the server to upgrade not. With RemoteForward(R), you can 'push' the proxy to the server to upgrade:

`$ ssh -R 8888:proxy.i.xxx.com:8080 localadmin@server.i.xxx.com`

then set environment variables e.g. `http_proxy` and the like on the SSH environment to `localhost:8888`, you can now invoke the frontend of package manager and pass the current environment to it via -E option of `sudo(8)`:

`localadmin@server.i.xxx.com:~$ sudo -E apt-get <subcommand>`

***

`DynamicForward` is to open a SOCKS server `[bindaddr:]port` on the local endpoint, and data will be tunneled to the remote host. Conceptually, its effect is like "PULLing" a SOCKS server running on the remote host to `[bindaddr:]port` with `LocalForward`, but the whole works are done by the SSH connection.

These forward ports can even be dynamically added after an SSH connection with pseudo-terminal is created. The escape sequence `~C` can be used after a new line, and a special prompt `ssh>` will be given after the escape sequence gets input successfully. `-L`, `-R` and `-D` instructions can then be used after the prompt to add new forwardings to this SSH connection. `-KL [bindaddr:]port`, `-KR [bindaddr:]port` and `-KD [bindaddr:]port` can be used to cancel existing forwardings.

Several options to mention below works according to the forwarding concept.

###### ForwardX11(X,~x)

Forward the local X11 server socket (TCP or UNIX) assigned with `DISPLAY` environment variable to the remote (usually a TCP one under `localhost`), and set `DISPLAY` of the remote environment to it.

This is useful to log into remote host from an environment with X11. X clients can be invoked from the shell launched by remote endpoint, e.g.

***

`$ ssh -X user@remote.host.xxx.com`

`user@remote.host.xxx.com:~$ gnome-system-monitor`

***

and the GUI of `gnome-system-monitor(1)` of remote.host.xxx.com will be displayed on the local X server.

###### ForwardAgent(A,~a)

Forward the local SSH agent socket (usually UNIX) assigned with `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to the remote (usually a UNIX one), and set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` of the remote environment to it.

Use this to eliminate the need to store secret keys on the remote host if we are in a scene in which we need to remotely log into a host first in order to log into more hosts only accessible from the first hosts.

***

Assuming you can access a.xxx.com, and a.xxx.com can access b.xxx.com, but you cannot access b.xxx.com directly. Provided that you have ssh keys to authenticate both a and b, you can now both keys to your LOCAL ssh-agent:

`$ ssh-add -t 300 a.key`
`$ ssh-add -t 300 b.key`
`$ ssh -A userA@a.xxx.com`

Now, your socket to the local ssh-agent has been forwarded to a.xxx.com and stored to `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` in the environment for userA@a.xxx.com. So,

`userA@a.xxx.com:~$ ssh userB@b.xxx.com`

will pass the authentication to b.xxx.com provided that a valid key has been registered to your local ssh-agent.

***

###### ProxyJump(J): [user@]host[:port]

Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the jump `host` and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.

***

Like the last example, but this time you only want to log into b.xxx.com, so you could use a.xxx.com as a ProxyJump:

`$ ssh -J userA@a.xxx.com userB@b.xxx.com`

after you pass the authentication to both a and b, you will get a command prompt `userB@b.xxx.com:~$`.

***

###### IdentityFile(i): identity_file & PKCS11Provider(I): pkcs11_library

`IdentityFile` is to assign additional authentication identity files like `~/.ssh/id_dsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, while `PKCS11Provider` is to assign a pkcs11 module library, e.g. `opensc-pkcs11.so`. Both can be used for authentication, and PIN will be asked when needed.

###### Compression(C)

Enable zlib compression on the SSH connection level, which means all multiplexed streams benefits from it.
